This is the music sample site V2! Our first version of the project had too many parts, too many redundant code and didn't mesh well with each other or there were "dead spots" in the code where code wasn't utilized and it was just taking up space. Through several group meetings, we decided for the Minimal Viable Product (MVP) we would slash all the things we couldn't get to work and only focus on things that did work. We used the Deezer API for handling music and playing the samples, and refactored the majority of the code.
